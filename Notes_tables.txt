CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS some_database; (IF NOT EXISTS command to ensure that your database will only be created if it does not already exist)

an e.g of this

Joins:

SELECT * = select all columns
FROM table1 t1 = t1 is an alias
JOIN table2 t2 on t1.field1=t2.field2; = which column in the first table and which coloumn in the second table match

SELECTS * FROM film f JOIN series s on f.series_id=s.id


SELECT * FROM city c1 JOIN country c2 ON c1.Name=c2.capital;
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.field1=t2.field2;




SELECT customer_id, forename, city
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id=(
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_id=1
